# App Engine transparent proxy
Google Cloud Platform AppEngine transparent proxy

Useful to use App Engine service as a facade for Compute Engine instances
or standalone servers having permanent IP address.

The main purpose and benefit of using transparent proxy is to obtain a
*.appspot.com domain name with a valid SSL certificate in order to connect
to Compute Engine HTTP endpoints without additional settings.
